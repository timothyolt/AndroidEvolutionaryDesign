First things first, let's get an image showing on the screen.
No network, no assets, just a basic old bitmap on an ImageView.

Thinking of two approaches.

Option A: Android objects come out of the Presenter object
String resources are processed somewhere before the Presenter and passed out
Images are process somewhere before the Presenter and passed out
We may return a Drawable, which traps some Android API in the Presenter API
But if the goal is for the View layer to be humble we either need a Presenter that returns a Drawable,
Or Option B, some kind of Adapter that takes the Presenter output and returns a Drawable
At this stage, the shape of the code is more unknown and we don't know
whether mixing Android API with Presentation Logic will become cumbersome.
Option A is less objects and less complex, so I vote we go that way and deal with it
when/if coupling rears it's ugly head
